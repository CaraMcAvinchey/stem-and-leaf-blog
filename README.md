## DESIGN CHOICES

### Colors
<img width="538" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97494262/209437405-63db90ed-fd86-4285-8a19-002c73a2d1a7.png">

- The space background image inspired the color palette of the website and links to the theme of the game. 
- The headings and body text are white to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user.
- Background of the header and footer is a light purple to ensure clear contrast and delineation between sections.
- All text and icon elements have a semi-transparent purple background to ensure the text has contrast from the background.
- The icons are orange to add contrast from the purple palette.

### Typography
<img width="896" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97494262/209437426-7c754f60-85b0-4d60-9f17-04caedb8f635.png">

- The font combination was chosen using guidance from Mai Knoblovits [here](https://artisanthemes.io/great-google-font-combinations-ready-use/)
- The logo and headings use ZCOOL QingKe HuangYou and body text uses Open Sans with a fall-back font of san-serif.
- The choice of fonts were selected using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Images/Icons
<img width="351" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97494262/209437645-30a1ff77-27cb-4eea-a342-6aa1592cb81d.png">

- The background image matches with the space theme of the game and creates a sense of depth without disrupting the foreground.
- The rules image provides a clear diagram of the game moves and results.
- The icons are used consistently across the site for game controls and in the rules.

### Animations
- The buttons across the site have a subtle grow effect when hovered over by the user.

### Responsiveness
- The website was designed using flexbox instead of float or grid to avoid fixed heights and ensure responsiveness throughout the website.
